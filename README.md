![Dashboard](https://github.com/Chano30/Live_dashboard/blob/master/image_dashboard_1.png)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the real-time monitoring of desktop system performance through a Power BI dashboard. Data retrieval is facilitated using Python, with SQL Server serving as the database backend.

## Used Tools:
* Python
* SQL Server
* Power BI
  
## Challenges Faced:
Throughout this project, I embarked on a journey to assess different databases, namely PostgreSQL, MySQL, and ultimately, SQL Server. PostgreSQL and MySQL presented compatibility issues with Power BI. While MySQL could be connected to\
Power BI with the installation of mysql-connector-net, it lacked the crucial 'auto-refresh' functionality required for live data presentation. PostgreSQL posed multiple challenges, despite being a popular choice among developers.\
\
Ultimately, SQL Server emerged as the most compatible option, offering an array of features seamlessly integrated with Power BI.

## Key Insights:
- Comprehensive pre-planning of tool selection is imperative before project commencement.
- It is essential to conduct thorough research when encountering obstacles, as a deep understanding of the solutions employed can prevent similar issues in future endeavors.
